Subject: API Access Paused - Review Request
From: asadullahshafique@hotmail.com

---

Hi Anthropic Team,

My Claude Code API access has been paused (error: "feedback quality doesn't meet threshold"). 

ACCOUNT: asadullahshafique@hotmail.com
USE CASE: Panaversity student building Claude skills for Hackathon III
PROJECT: https://github.com/asadullah48/hackathon-superpower

I've been developing open-source Claude Desktop skills and CAPS playbooks for cloud-native applications. The VS Code extension API pause is blocking my hackathon development.

Could you please:
1. Review my account status
2. Explain what triggered the pause
3. Advise on restoration steps

I'm committed to following all guidelines and maintaining quality standards.

Thank you,
Asadullah
Karachi, Pakistan
