Subject: Claude Code API Access Paused - Student Account Review Request
From: asadullahshafique@hotmail.com

---

Dear Anthropic Support Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request a review of my Claude Code API access, which has been paused with the following error:

"Your access has been paused - the feedback quality from your account doesn't meet our current threshold. We'll notify you by email if this changes."

ACCOUNT DETAILS
Email: asadullahshafique@hotmail.com
GitHub: github.com/asadullah48
LinkedIn: [Your LinkedIn profile if you have one]
Subscription: Claude Pro (active)

MY USE CASE
I'm a student at Panaversity (Pakistan's leading AI university) currently participating in Hackathon III focused on cloud-native agentic applications. I've been using Claude Code to:

1. Develop production-grade Claude Desktop skills
2. Create CAPS (Coding Agent Playbook Spec) playbooks
3. Build automation scripts for Kubernetes deployments
4. Document AI agent workflows and best practices

PROJECT REPOSITORY
I've built an open-source skills marketplace for Claude Code:
https://github.com/asadullah48/hackathon-superpower

This includes:
- 3 production-ready skills (agents-md-generator, caps-format-validator, kubernetes-health-check)
- 6 additional skills in development (Kafka, Dapr, MCP servers, etc.)
- Complete documentation and templates for the community
- CAPS playbooks for universal AI agent compatibility

WHAT HAPPENED
I was actively developing and testing these skills using the Claude Code VS Code extension when I encountered the API pause. I had recently:
- Switched from Bonsai CLI authentication to Claude Pro login
- Been testing skills repeatedly during development cycles
- Running validation scripts on CAPS playbooks
- Generating documentation for multiple repositories

CURRENT IMPACT
- ✅ Claude Desktop: Still working (skills installed successfully)
- ✅ claude.ai: Still working
- ❌ VS Code Extension: API access paused (blocking development)

QUESTIONS & REQUESTS
I would greatly appreciate your guidance on:

1. What specific feedback quality issues were detected with my account?
2. What steps can I take to restore API access?
3. Are there best practices I should follow to maintain quality standards?
4. Is this related to rapid testing during development, or other factors?

MY COMMITMENT
As a student developer building for the Claude Code ecosystem, I'm committed to:
- Following all usage guidelines and best practices
- Providing constructive feedback to improve Claude's capabilities
- Contributing open-source skills and documentation
- Representing Anthropic's values in my educational community

I understand that quality controls are necessary to maintain the integrity of the platform. I'm eager to learn what I can improve and ensure my usage patterns align with your standards.

TIMELINE
I'm currently working on a hackathon deadline (Phase 3-5 implementation due soon) and would greatly appreciate expedited review if possible. However, I understand you may have many requests and will patiently await your response.

EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT
Panaversity is pioneering AI education in Pakistan:
- Website: https://panaversity.org
- Focus: Agentic AI, Cloud-Native Development, GenAI Applications
- Hackathon III: Building production-ready AI agent systems

I'm documenting this entire journey (challenges included) as a learning experience to share with the Pakistani developer community through LinkedIn and technical blog posts.

Thank you for taking the time to review my account. I deeply value Claude Code as a development tool and hope to continue contributing to the ecosystem.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Best regards,
Asadullah (asadullah48)
